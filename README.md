# Portfolio Website

***

### by Gavin Pili

### **TL;DR**  Multi page responsive website with subtle animations using CSS and some JS where CSS is not possible. This project is working but continousuly being developed with content and styling changes.

**You can view the webpage here: www.gavinpili.com**

This webpage was created using the following:

* HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
* Google Fonts API
* Font Awesome Icons v4.7.0 library
* All images used are by the author and cannot be used by others.

**My Design Goals:**
* Soft colour scheme that is modern and welcoming
* Create a simple UI with some animation effects
* Use images as part of a portfolio website
* Use Google fonts to create a logo without actually creating a logo outside VSCode
* Use of minimal colour theme but still present a cohesive layout
* Consider using floating elements, transparency, opacity, shadows
* Mobile-friendly layout

**My Coding Goals:**
* Create a homepage where the image with text overlay as initial navigation
* Use animation in a subtle way without using too much JavaScript
* Create a logotype using CSS
* Use comments strategically
* Codes should be well organised and easy to read
* Create separate .js, .css, .img folders for better organisation
* Use animated and hidden side menu (curtain menu)
* Create a fun 404 page with simple animation using CSS only
* Use CSS to create a wireframe look font
* Add a filter function to view gallery images based on categories

**Trajectory of this project:**
* Use this webpage as template for creative portfolio projects for others to use
* Add collapsible text field when clicking on images > to show more content about the image
* Add Dark Mode switch
* Create Blog page and template

**Here is a sample screenshot of the webpage:**
